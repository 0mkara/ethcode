# Ethereum IDE in VSCode

## Development

Run following commands in the terminal

```shell
yarn install
yarn run build
```
And then press F5, in Extension Development Host session, run `Ethereum: Solidity compile` command from command palette.

## Under the hood

Things we did on top of Create React App TypeScript template

* We inline `index.html` content in `ext-src/extension.ts` when creating the webview
* We set strict security policy for accessing resources in the webview.
  * Only resources in `/build` can be accessed
  * Onlu resources whose scheme is `vscode-resource` can be accessed.
* For all resources we are going to use in the webview, we change their schemes to `vscode-resource`
* Since we only allow local resources, absolute path for styles/images (e.g., `/static/media/logo.svg`) will not work. We add a `.env` file which sets `PUBLIC_URL` to `./` and after bundling, resource urls will be relative.
* We add baseUrl `<base href="${vscode.Uri.file(path.join(this._extensionPath, 'build')).with({ scheme: 'vscode-resource' })}/">` and then all relative paths work.

## Limitations

Right now you can only run production bits (`yarn run build`) in the webview, how to make dev bits work (webpack dev server) is still unknown yet. Suggestions and PRs welcome !
